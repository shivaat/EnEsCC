"It's a Europe of division, it's a Europe of disharmony, it's a Europe that is a recipe for resentment" 
Britain’s anti-EU leader Nigel Farage has lashed out a joint European Parliament address by the German Chancellor and French President. 
Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande asked for more Europe and more co-operation during their speeches in Strasbourg. 
But Farage said they did little to reassure voters. 
“This isn’t a Europe of peace, it’s a Europe of division, it’s a Europe of disharmony, it’s a Europe that is a recipe for resentment. And yet, when faced with all this failure, both of you said the same thing today, you said: ‘Europe isn’t working – so we must have more Europe,’ More of the same failing!’ he said during the parliament session. 
Belgian Liberal member Guy Verhofstadt welcomed the call for a united response to tackling Europe’s migrant crisis. 
“The only good reaction to this is not to retreat behind national borders, as the nationalists are saying. But is to overcome this crisis doing a jump forward and leap forward in the integration of the European Union,” he said. 
Merkel and Hollande presented a united front to a parliament in which the centre-right and centre-left mainstream blocs are dominant but face vocal, mounting criticism.
