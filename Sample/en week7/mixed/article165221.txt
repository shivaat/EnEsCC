Brendan Rodgers sacked as Liverpool manager 00:51 
An announcement on the club's official website sealed Rodgers' fate after three and a half years in charge, the Northern Irishman having initially been given the news in a phone call. 
"We would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Brendan Rodgers for the significant contribution he has made to the club and express our gratitude for his hard work and commitment," Liverpool's American owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) said in a statement. 
"All of us have experienced some wonderful moments with Brendan as manager and we are confident he will enjoy a long career in the game.

"Although this has been a difficult decision, we believe it provides us with the best opportunity for success on the pitch." 
FSG is an American sports investment company owned by John W. Henry and chaired by Tom Werner. The pair took over Liverpool in 2010 from previous owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, while FSG also owns Major League Baseball side the Boston Red Sox and the home stadiums of both teams. 
Rodgers, who arrived from Swansea City in 2012, gained accolades for the expansive football which Liverpool played in coming so close to adding to its tally of 18 top-flight titles in England. 
Suarez and Daniel Sturridge helped them score over 100 goals, but a costly slip by captain Steven Gerrard in a 2-0 defeat to Chelsea left the team agonizingly short.
