FORMER LONG-SERVING Louth footballer Stephen Melia has passed away. 
An influential midfielder, the Ardee man’s distinguished intercounty career spanned over 17 years — from 1985 to 2002 — and he made 179 appearances for the Wee County during that time. 
Melia, who died peacefully and surrounded by his family this morning , also enjoyed spells in club football with John Mitchells, O’Dwyers and St Josephs. 
“The Gaelic Players Association would like to convey its condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of former Louth footballer Stephen Melia who has sadly passed away,” reads a statement released this afternoon. 
GPA Chief Executive Dessie Farrell added: “On behalf of players past and present I’d like to express my sympathy to Stephen’s family, his club mates and former county colleagues and everyone associated with him. 
“Stephen was a legendary figure in Louth football and on the county stage – a true warrior who endured and gave so much to the game and county he loved. 
He was a great players’ man, a strong and courageous advocate for the Gaelic Players Association, particularly in the early years of the Association. 
“On a personal level I was privileged to play against Stephen, he was a great footballer, a powerful opponent and a wonderful person. I’m deeply saddened to learn of his passing. May he rest in peace. ”
