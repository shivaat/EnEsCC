Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz could miss the Champions League games against Real Madrid on October 21 and November 3, with goalkeeper Kevin Trapp already ruled out.  
The French newspaper Le Parisien reported on Sunday the Brazilian will be out for “at least one month” after injuring his knee in his country’s game with Chile, which they lost 2-0.  
Brazil had already confirmed he will miss their next World Cup qualifier, which is against Venezuela on Tuesday.  
Marquinhos, also of PSG, came on for Luiz against Chile and is tipped to take his place in the match against Venezuela as well.  
Trapp, 25, will be out for five weeks after injuring his leg in a training session last Thursday. He was vital in the recent win over Marseille, saving a penalty.  
It’s expected that Salvatore Sirigu, who was PSG’s No.1 until the arrival of Trapp, will take his place.
