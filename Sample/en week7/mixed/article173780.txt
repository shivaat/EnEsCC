From their calculations, MBW figured out that Australia lands sixth on a list of countries that spent the most money, per person, on music in 2014 â€” covering record sales, sync, and performance rights. 
If Australia's $20-ish a year number seems quite low, it is worth remembering that not every single person in our nation's population, of over 23 million, is a dedicated music lover. 
For every fan who regularly buys records, grabs paid downloads, or subscribes to a monthly streaming service, there might be five more people that do just one (or none) of those things. 
Australians might be showing their music fandom in other ways too, like on gigs and concerts. 
After all, last year the live music industry pumped to the tune of a whopping $15.7 billion . 
Of course there are other factors at work that these figures do not reflect: like how often people might be getting their music for free, through ad-supported streaming services or even illegal downloads. 
That is worth considering given Australia's love for TV, movie, and music piracy. 
Music piracy is such an issue in Australia that the Government has intervened to combat it with legislation blocking pirating sites, as reported by triple j's Hack earlier this year . 
The good news is that we are still pulling our weight for the record industry compared to the 10 countries with the lowest per person spend on music in 2014, which MBW also measured. 
They found that China and India (two countries with populations of around 1.3 billion people) were the worst in that field, both spending less than 15 cents on music per year.
