NEW YORK (AP) — Bad boy Ricky Gervais is set to notch his fourth turn as host of the Golden Globe Awards. 
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association and NBC announced Monday that the sharp-tongued humorist and film star will preside over the 73rd Annual Golden Globe Awards, set for January 10. The three-hour broadcast, airing live coast-to-coast on NBC, will kick off the 2016 film awards season. 
Gervais scored laughs and raised hackles with his riotous hosting style for three consecutive years from 2010 to 2012.
