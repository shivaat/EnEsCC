Sky News - Congress Reaches Budget Deal With White House 
House Republican leaders have struck a budget deal with the White House aimed at averting a government shutdown and holding off a potential debt crisis. 
Speaker John Boehner, in one of his final acts in the role before he leaves Congress on Friday, appealed to Republicans to pass the agreement before Representative Paul Ryan takes over as speaker later this week. 
The deal, which involves an increase in the federal borrowing limit, would solve an immediate political issue for Mr Ryan, who is set to be elected speaker on Thursday . 
It would also take budget showdowns and government shutdown battles off the table until after the 2016 presidential election - potentially helping Republican candidates who would otherwise face tough questions about turmoil in the Republican-led Congress. 
Congress must raise the federal borrowing limit by 3 November or risk a first-ever default. 
Money to pay for government operations will also run out on 11 December if Congress fails to act. 
The deal would see the Pentagon and domestic agencies given two years of budget relief, allowing an additional $80bn of spending in exchange for cuts elsewhere in the budget. 
It could also see the $18.1trn debt limit suspended through March 2017, weeks after the next president is sworn in. 
Under the proposals, further increases for the Pentagon would be designated as emergency war funds, which could be made exempt from budget caps. 
The added spending would be offset by more than $168bn in long-term savings from reforms to the Social Security Disability Insurance programme. 
Mr Boehner has planned for members of Congress to vote on the deal on Wednesday.
