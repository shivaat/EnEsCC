MILAN (AP) — For those who are not going to make this year's edition of the Biennale contemporary art fair in Venice, there is no reason to despair. 
Officials on Wednesday announced that a selection of some 4,000 artworks on display will be visible immediately online using technology developed by Google's Cultural Institute. 
Web-based visitors can also take a virtual tour of the main venues, the Giardini, where many national pavilions are located, and the Arsenale, which hosts the main curated show. 
Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said that the collaboration "confirms how much technology is a great ally to promote our cultural heritage." 
The Biennale contemporary art fair, held every two years in Venice, closes on Nov. 22, but the virtual rendering will remain available.
