The race to succeed Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner as Argentina's president appeared headed for a runoff Monday, with her party's candidate in a tight race with the outgoing mayor of Buenos Aires. 
With nearly 80% of polling places counted, Daniel Scioli of Fernandez's Front for Victory coalition and Mauricio Macri of the Let's Change coalition each had 35.48%, according to official results . 
In third place at 21.23% was Sergio Massa, who earlier Sunday said his coalition, United for a New Alternative, did not get the numbers it was hoping for and was not in the top two. 
According to the constitution, to win the presidency a candidate must either win 45% of the vote or have an advantage of 10 percentage points over their closest rival. 
If neither requirement is met, the top two candidates compete in a runoff, which would be held November 22.

Fernandez was elected in 2007, succeeding her husband, Nestor Kirchner, who served one term. He died of a heart attack five years ago this week. 
She won re-election in 2011. 
Both Massa and Scioli, whom Fernandez endorsed as her successor, anticipated being in a second round of voting. 
"It is an irreversible trend at a national level: There is a second round in Argentina," Sen. Ernesto Sanz said from the headquarters of Let's Change before the results began coming in. 
Asked about the possibility of a runoff, Alberto Samid, vice president of the Central Market and a close confidante of Scioli, told CNN: "If there is a second round, we will win twice." 
A major issue in the election is whether the new leader will end the country's fight against New York hedge funds , an unresolved debt debacle that has shut out Argentina from much of the global economy while suffering from massive inflation, declining cash reserves and major economic growth.
