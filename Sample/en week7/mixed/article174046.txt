Luis Enrique reckons Pedro Rodriguez may have some regrets over ditching Barcelona for Chelsea in the summer.  
Pedro’s Chelsea career got off to a flying start, but he has since managed just one goal in seven appearances since his stunning debut against West Brom.  
His move to London has also coincided with Jose Mourinho’s worst start to a season as a manager. 
"We know what the situation was with Pedro, we understand it, it's logical, he wanted to play more and over the course of a player's career you have to make decisions,” Luis Enrique said. 
"Perhaps now he might want to change that decision I don't know. 
"It's not a question of us missing him, that's what life in football is like." 
If he has stayed at Camp Nou, the Spain international forward would have received plenty of minutes.  
With Lionel Messi heading a list of injuries which also features Rafinha and Andres Iniesta, Pedro would have been a useful player to have to come into the side.
