Jimmy Roberts, a five-time Stanley Cup champion and the first player taken by the St. Louis Blues in the 1967 NHL expansion draft, died of cancer on Friday at the age of 75. 
"The St. Louis Blues and the Blues Alumni organization are deeply saddened by the passing of the original Blue Jimmy Roberts," the team said in a statement. 
"Jimmy was the franchise's first-ever draft pick and was instrumental in building the foundation of Blues hockey as a player and upholding its tradition as an alumnus. 
"His tireless contributions to St. Louis, the Blues and the game of hockey as a whole will forever live as an example for future generations to follow." 
Roberts, a defenseman, led the Blues to the Stanley Cup Final in each of the fledgling franchise's first three seasons. 
By that time he had already won two Stanley Cup titles with the Canadiens in 1965 and 1966. 
In the following year's expansion draft, designed to accommodate a doubling of the NHL's size from six to 12 teams, expansion teams were allowed to select 20 players from the established clubs. 
Roberts eventually returned to the Canadiens, earning three more titles with Montreal in 1973, 1976 and 1977.
