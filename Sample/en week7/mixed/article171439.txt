Press Association - The University of Sussex agreed to pay £20,000 in damages 
A university has apologised and agreed to pay £20,000 damages to a former student for falsely claiming he was involved in the illegal occupation of the institution. 
The University of Sussex accepted there was "no truth" in claims that Michael Segalov, who was studying law with international relations, led an unlawful occupation and committed crime on campus. 
Its apology came following the publication of two news bulletins on the university's website in 2013 after several students, including Mr Segalov, were suspended over protests against privatisation of services on campus. 
The sector's complaints body, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education, later deemed his suspension unreasonable. 
Reacting to the apology, Mr Segalov, 22, said: "The response is twofold - that there was no one leading anything and, secondly, the claims (the university) put up on the website were based on nothing. 
"They weren't put to us and no evidence was provided. I'm pleased that there will be a rectification so that people know it was nonsense." 
The university said: "The university is making this unreserved apology to Michael Segalov because it is the right thing to do. 
"We must make it absolutely clear that Mr Segalov did not engage in criminal activity. These matters have now been resolved and we hope this correction will help everyone to move on. 
"We are immensely proud of our students and will continue to support them to reach their potential and lead successful lives."
