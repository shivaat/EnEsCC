WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen  may have to set aside more than the 6.5 billion euros ($7.4 billion) it has calculated so far to cover the costs of an emissions fraud if the scandal has a negative effect on car sales, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 
"The 6.5 billion apply to the recall," Matthias Mueller told reporters after a tour of VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg. "I can only speculate about any further provisions. Should there be a change in sales volumes, we would react rapidly."
